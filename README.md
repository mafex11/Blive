1.this is half part of blockchain livestream. im saving it here because i dont want to make changes that will ruin whole app. in this part user can log in using metamask, and create stream and start streaming via given stream key thru obs. in next part ill make sure that the watchers can watch the streams that are already been streamed.\n
2.whole app works, and just need front end and blockchain backend now.
